# 📰 Fake News Classifier

A machine learning application to classify news articles as **FAKE** or **REAL** using natural language processing (NLP) and a trained model.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to combat misinformation by identifying whether a news article is real or fake using machine learning techniques. It uses a confusion matrix to evaluate accuracy and performance.

## ✅ Features

- Text preprocessing and vectorization
- Model training using Scikit-learn
- Evaluation using confusion matrix
- High accuracy in classifying news articles
- Clean UI with Streamlit (optional if added)

## 🧠 Algorithms & Techniques Used

- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / Other ML models
- Confusion Matrix for evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score (if included)
